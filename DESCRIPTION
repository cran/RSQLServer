Description: Utilises The jTDS Project's JDBC 3.0 SQL Server
    driver to extend the RJDBC classes and DBI methods. It defines a
    SQLServerDriver, SQLServerConnection & SQLServerRsult S4 classes as
    extensions of the RJDBC equivalent classes with most DBI
    methods being thin extensions of the methods defined by RJDBC classes.
    However, the dbConnect interface is more convenient, and the data reading
    and writing capabilities found in RJDBC's fetch and dbWriteTable methods
    have been refined. The package also implements a SQL backend to the dplyr
    package.
